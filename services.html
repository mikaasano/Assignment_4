       <h2>Our Services</h2>       
       
    <h3>Kayak Rentals</h3>
       
    <p>Whether you're a solo explorer or planning a group adventure, we offer a wide range of high-quality kayaks for rent. Choose from single or tandem kayaks and embark on your own self-guided journey.</p>

       
    <h3>Guided Kayak Tours</h3>
       
    <p>Join one of our expert-led kayak tours and let us take you on an unforgettable exploration of the area's most stunning waterways. From peaceful rivers to breathtaking coastlines, our tours cater to both beginners and experienced paddlers.
    </p>
       
    <p>Depending on the weather, we have two different tours that we offer:
    </p>
       <ul>
           <li ><b>McMicking Park to Beacon Hill Park:</b> Enjoy the beautiful natural scenery Victoria has to offer. This route is better for sunny days as it is more exposed to open water.</li>
           <li ><b>Rainbow Park to James Bay:</b> Observe the cityscape that makes up Victoria. This route is better for rainy/windy days as it is more sheltered and protected from waves.</li>
       </ul>
